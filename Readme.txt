In this project we have a form where user(financial advisor) gives input through the form and minimum age should be displayed on the frontend. But as we dont know connection of frontend with python we made a spring api and used it to get the minimum age 

coming tho graphs we thought of using plotly to plot the graph on frontend but the api is not responding so we couldnt do it.

The mutual fund suggestion was an end to end solution where the ui gets the name of the fund which is more returns less risk we used sharpe ratio to evaluate the mutual fund.

we used python to display the monthly returns but we couldnt able to connect it to frontend, because we don't know how to integrate ui with python.
